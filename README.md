# astronomy
The WebGL React client for astro-api is open source and is currently available at:

      git clone https://github.com/FrankThomasTveter/astronomy.git

The following Ubuntu terminal commands will run the (development) client on your browser:

      cd astronomy
      sudo apt-get install npm
      npm install
      npm start

The framework is loosely based on the met.no boilerplate. It still has
a long todo list:
   * correct earth/moon shadow (shader level)
   * atmospheric effects (shader level)
   * star names
   * constellations, lines and names (dashed lines in 3D)
   * longer ephemerides (millennia), star motion
   * adjustable observer height (0->10ly)
   * seamless zooming and "targetting"
   * semless window management
